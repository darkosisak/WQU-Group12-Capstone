# WQU-Group12-Capstone
-- The WQU Capstone repository for group 12, i.e. Darko Sisak --

This is a repository pertinent to Darko Sisak's Capstone project for the MSc in Financial Engineering at the WorldQuant University.

The project is named An Event-driven Machine Learning Approach in Designing Short-term Trading Models and, as its name implies, presents a method integrating event-based signaling and intrinsic time with machine learning.

The complete code used in the Capstone project is contained in the Capstone_course.ipynb. This includes the machine learning modeling part and the data structures section dealing with the analysis of different bar construction methods.

## Disclaimer

The Trend Scanning technique introduces a look-forward bias. The purpose of the code is to prove or disprove assumptions presented in the Capstone project. Please take this into consideration if you intend to use it for trading.

## Running the code in Colaboratory

You can seamlessly run the Capstone_course.ipynb in Colaboratory if you have a gmail account by clicking on the Colaboratory button on the top of the notebook.

The text cells in the notebook and the comments in the code should ensure you an easy ride through the whole process.

## The data

The data is hosted live on the webserver of the author, so you don't have to download any locally.

## About the Addendum (Data Structures) part at the end of the notebook

The code in this section has been run in the beginning, before modelling, to aid in the decision which bar method to use. It has been moved now to the end, rather than deleted or put in a separate notebook and is not supposed to be run again as long as the instrument to be modeled remains the same (GBP/USD).
